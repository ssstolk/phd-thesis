The recent publication of a new OntoLex module for lexicography, lexicog, reflects its increasing importance for digital lexicography. However, not all aspects of digital lexicography have been covered to the same extent. In particular, supplementary information drawn from corpora such as frequency information, links to attestations, and collocation data were considered to be beyond the scope of lexicog. Therefore, the OntoLex community has put forward the proposal for a novel module for frequency, attestation and corpus information (FrAC), that not only covers the requirements of digital lexicography, but also accommodates essential data structures for lexical information in natural language processing. This paper introduces the current state of the OntoLex-FrAC vocabulary, describes its structure, some selected use cases, elementary concepts and fundamental definitions, with a focus on frequency and attestations.",

abstract = {The study of ancient cultures is hindered by the incomplete survival of material artifacts, so we commonly underestimate the diversity of cultural production in historic societies. To correct this survivorship bias, we applied unseen species models from ecology to gauge the loss of narratives from medieval Europe, such as the romances about King Arthur. The estimates obtained are compatible with the scant historic evidence. In addition to events such as library fires, we identified the original evenness of cultural populations as an overlooked factor in these assemblages’ stability in the face of immaterial loss. We link the elevated evenness in island literatures to analogous accounts of ecological and cultural diversity in insular communities. These analyses call for a wider application of these methods across the heritage sciences.},

address={Oxford},
pages={352},
keywords={English; Historical Thesaurus of English; Mapping Metaphor; metaphor; semantic categories; semantic domains ER},
abstract={Metaphor is pervasive in language, and recent interest has focused on the systematic connections between different concepts, such as heat and anger (fuming, inflamed), sight and understanding (clear, see), or bodies and landscape (hill-foot, river-mouth). Lack of a comprehensive data source has made it difficult to obtain an overview of this phenomenon in any language, but this situation was transformed for English by the completion in 2009 of the Historical Thesaurus of English (HT). The only historical thesaurus ever produced for any language, the HT is organized in semantic categories, each containing lists of words used to express a given concept at particular points of time. It is thus possible to compare historical links between categories from a new perspective, gaining fresh insights into how the language has developed. The chapters in this volume derive from the Mapping Metaphor with the Historical Thesaurus project at the University of Glasgow, which has undertaken an empirical investigation of the foundations and nature of metaphor using this unique evidence base. Each chapter offers a case study focusing on metaphor in a different semantic domain of English, including Address, Animals, Authority, Colour, Death, Excitement, Fear, Food, Head, Landscape, Mental Illness, Plants, Reading, Theft, and Weapons. The chapters are grouped into three sections, corresponding to the three main divisions of the HT itself---the External World, the Mental World, and the Social World---and each section is preceded by an introduction setting the chapters within a broader theoretical context.},
